Hello friends of Wikipedia Asian Month

This is Addis Wang, one of the organizers of the Wikipedia Asian Month. It was my great pleasure working with you in the past (two) years. Over two years of Wikipedia Asian Month, we together engaged more than 2000 Wikipedians and contributed more than 15,000 high quality articles to Wikipedia in 50 languages, and Wikisource. Undoubtedly, Wikipedia Asian Month is the largest annual Wikipedia online editing event, and you made it.

In order to ensure the sustainability of the WAM, as well as providing more organization experience to other WAM organizers, we are seriously looking for members of the international team. It is a volunteer work and will require some time commitment as we need to keep the team small (reduce communication cost). Besides the great experience of learning how to organize an international events, you will also receive a Wikipedia T-shirt no matter where you live (I will try to make that happens) and a volunteer certificate if you required one. Fluently English conversation capability and time commitment are the only two requirement from us. No experience needed since this is more like a training program.

If you can fully understand my email and write back a short introduction of you (100 words), then you are qualified. So please do send me an email if you interested. Don't reply this email, please send to addis@wikimedianyc.org

For further event information, I will send another email after we get something prepared. 

If you have questions for postcards that are sent for last year, we will start to get a volunteer organizer to deal with it. 

Best Wishes,
Addis Wang
